## Portfolio website

This website was a learning project for me as it was my first time using React.js, Sanity, Framer Motion and SCSS. I'm continously updating the website and making changes and polishing the code. 

Learned a lot about how React works, how to connect CMS to Frontend, how to use Netlify, and overall about CSS, JavaScript and HTML.
