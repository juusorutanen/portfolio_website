## Portfolio website

This website was created with React.js, Sanity, Framer Motion for animations and SCSS. The website's project section gets data from Sanity's CMS. Darkmode was implemented with createContext. The map in the contact section was implemented by using React simple maps library. 

Learned a lot about how React works and how to think in React, how to connect CMS to Frontend, how to use Netlify and Netlify Forms, and overall about CSS/Scss, JavaScript and HTML.
